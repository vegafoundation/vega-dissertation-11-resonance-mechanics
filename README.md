## Definition

Resonance Mechanics is the formal description of mechanisms through which resonance
between information states arises, is maintained, and collapses.

## Core Mechanisms

### Generation
How resonance between states initiates

### Maintenance
How resonance persists over time

### Amplification
How resonance strengthens through coherence

### Interference
How states reinforce or cancel each other

### Collapse
How superposed states resolve to single outcomes

## What This IS

- Mathematical framework for resonance dynamics
- Description of state transitions
- Formalization of resonance phenomena

## What This IS NOT

- NOT new physics
- NOT implementation specification
- NOT quantum hardware claim
